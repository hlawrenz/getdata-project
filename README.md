# getdata-project

### Description

The run-analysis.R script merges the test and training sets, extracts
just the mean and standard deviation features for each measurment,
applies descriptive names to the activity tag and labels the columns.
It then outputs a summary data set containing the average of the
selected data points for each activity.

Descriptions of output data can be found in [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md)
